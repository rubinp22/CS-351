# CS-351

Initial run:

hash-00         359.80 real	   344.54 user	9.00 sys	2884 memory (KB)
hash-01         20.34 real	   16.89 user	1.52 sys	2896 memory (KB)
hash-02         15.57 real	   14.17 user	1.24 sys	2888 memory (KB)
hash-03         16.47 real	   15.22 user	1.12 sys	2896 memory (KB)
hash-04         14.50 real	   13.85 user	0.54 sys	5012368 memory (KB)

First-run analysis:

On comparing the system performance, the program hash-00 seemed to be significantly the slowest of all programs. As it took the longest for around 359.80 seconds in real time to run the first program using the full time command. In comparing the memory usage between the different programs, the hash-01 program and the hash-03 output had around the same memory of 2896 in Kilobytes. Which means the same amount of memory was taken up by the two programs despite the real time they each took in seconds to execute. With the same memory of 2896 KB, the hash-03 program executed 3.87 sec faster in real time, and .12 sec faster in system time than in hash-01 while using the same memory. With a second outlier being hash-04 it had the fastest performance of 14.5 seconds in real time, although it came at the cost of taking the greatest amount of memory. 

When seeing hash-04 performs the fastest with 2 sec more than hash-03, and by up to 6 sec than hash-0, the amount of memory is definitely not proportionate in comparison. Because the difference in memory for hash-04 is having 5,009,477 KB greater than the average (2891 KB) of all the other four programs. Which makes the hash-04 inefficient by a large sum in memory usage and for itâ€™s program to run the fastest. 

To maximize efficiency I would need to take in the factors of both time and memory usage into account. And in hash-00 which took the greatest amount of time in 359.80 seconds and hash-04 which then took the greatest memory. Both of those outliers over compensated in time or memory by optimizing one of them from my point of view. The most time and memory efficient program would have to be hash-02 with the best time space complexity. Since it had the fastest time (15.57 seconds), and least amount of memory usage (2888 kb), from considering the more averaged out files from the hash-01 to hash-03 programs. 

Hash Optimization run:

344.95 real	331.27 user	10.20 sys	2888 memory (KB)
14.85 real	7.46 user	2.98 sys	2880 memory (KB)
7.82 real	6.52 user	0.99 sys	2880 memory (KB)
7.45 real	6.31 user	1.02 sys	3468 memory (KB)
6.72 real	6.23 user	0.39 sys	5012360 memory (KB)


Optimization analysis:

In comparing the timing for my both real time and user time. Hash-01 has very much increased the speed with Real time going from 20 sec to 14, and user time from around 17 sec to 7.5. The programs hash-02 to hash-04 were the most significant since their averages of around 15 (real sec) and 14 (user sec) times have increased in speed to averaging 7 seconds in real time and 6 dec in user time for those three programs. Though the Unit that had not had a predictable or stable change in measures were system time. Because they were around 9 sec for hash 0, and 1 sec for hash 1 to 3 at the initial runs. While for the optimized ones their system times were more rather broadley varied in my perspective than observing their initial run. The last two programs hash-03 and hash-04 seemed to be outliers as hash-03 increased in memory usage from 2896 kb to 3468 kb to compensate for greater its speed. And hash-4 program had stayed roughly the same in really high memory from 5012368 to 5012360 kilobytes. So if I were to compare the most optimized programs, it would be from hash-00 to hash-02 options. Where hash-02 and hash-03 had similar times for real time (between 7.82 and 7.45 sec) and similar for user time (6.52 and 6.31 sec). Though because hash two far outweighed in memory with taking only 2880 Kb over 3468 kb, then I would choose the second hash program, which although around seconds slower, the hash-02 has the highest memory to run time speed in the optimized version.

1. Some factors for hash-00 runtime can be from their heavy overhead in memory. Especially since the hash-00 program is one of the slowest in run time around 350 sec in real time. Because of the extended time, i think there is alot of copies in memory or I/O stream that should be going forth for the amount of data that is being read into memory.

2. Being both dynamically allocated memory, their is definitely a difference in their memory allocation. Since although in the initial run hash-01 has a time of around 20.34 and hash-02 of 15.57 secs, their difference is 14.85 sec and 7.82 sec in real time. Where this shows their difference in seconds increased, from a 5 second to around a 7 second difference between the programs. Which makes it a large enough difference in time wise, and especially after running opt program with both allocation methods.

3. There seemed to be an appreciable difference with a fixed size array, with hash-03. This showed especially when comparing the seconds in real time, of hash 3 initially with 16.47 sec and improving to 7.45 sec in real time. While hash-02 also improved by 7.75 sec (initially 15.57 - 7.82), the difference for hash-03 was 9.02 real secs. This shows hash-03 was faster by a large difference with run opt and in using the fixed array method for the hash-03. Which makes the fixed size array show a large enough difference in speed when optimized. This also shows a large enough difference by comparing it to hash-02 from their fixed array allocation that gets used.

4. There are some reasons why Hash-04 memory was some what larger. It can be that the contents were mapped directly to the address space. And that the memory that was reported was from the files full size, which means it shows more memory than the data being copied into the file. And it shows how the data in the file of hash-04 is being mapped but not how it is copied into memory.

5. Some compiler options that I tried included real, user, and sys time options for timing my hash programs being run. I also tried opt -03 which gave interesting results as well. The hash-01 program really improved significantly from 14.85 to 11.87 sec in real time. Hash-00 though improved by a small amount which still had taken long to run. And the other programs were slightly slower as a result of Opt -03 being run which showed how different hash programs are affected differently from the optimization level. Though the funroll-loops options made the memory more efficient in hash-03 to 2888 kb compared to 3468 with op -o2 that did not use the funroll loop option. While the memory improved in one hash, there was slower and different speeds in user or real time for others. Where with the hash programs it did reduce some use in memory when running it.
